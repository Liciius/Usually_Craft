It\\\'s been weeks since my last acquisition, and I feel the insatiable hunger for control growing stronger."]]','[["The basement below this creaky old house is perfect, a labyrinth of darkness that no one would suspect. I revel in the power I wield over those who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in my grasp."]]','[["Each new victim brings a unique thrill. Their fear, their desperation, it\\\'s a symphony that only I can conduct. The last one, a young woman with eyes like frightened deer, tried to escape. Foolish."]]','[["She didn\\\'t know about the secret passage, the one hidden behind the false wall in the storage room. It\\\'s amusing how easily people miss it. One would need to move the old, dusty book on the third shelf from the left."]]','[["Such a simple trigger, yet it opens up a whole new world of suffering.\\nThe basement is not just a place of captivity; it\\\'s my masterpiece. The walls are lined with soundproofing, ensuring that no scream, no plea for help, ever reaches the outside world."]]','[["The iron shackles on the walls are firm, a reminder to my captives that resistance is futile. I visit them occasionally, to remind them of their hopeless situation, to watch the light slowly fade from their eyes.\\nI\\\'ve had to be careful."]]','[["The townspeople are starting to notice the disappearances. They whisper about a curse, about a monster that prowls the night. If only they knew. But I am careful, meticulous. No one suspects the quiet, unassuming resident of this decrepit house."]]','[["I blend in, a ghost among the living.\\nThe cave beneath the basement is my true sanctuary. It\\\'s where I conduct my...experiments. The things I\\\'ve done down there would drive any sane person to madness. But not me. No, I thrive on it."]]','[["The damp, cold air, the echoes of my captives\\\' torment, it\\\'s intoxicating.\\nTonight, I will visit them again. I will remind them of their place, of their fate. And I will ensure that no one ever finds my hidden lair."]]','[["The secret must remain buried, just like the bodies I\\\'ve disposed of in the depths of that cave.\\nIf anyone were to discover the passage, they would not live to tell the tale. The house protects its secrets, just as I protect mine."]]','[["And so, I continue my work, in the shadows, in the silence, where no one can see the true horror that lies beneath."]]'],title:"Whispers of the Abyss",author:"Edgar Blackwood"},lore=['["",{"text":"In the depths of the Blackwood","italic":false}]','["",{"text":"Manor, Edgar\'s whispers are the","italic":false}]','["",{"text":"only company for the lost souls","italic":false}]','["",{"text":"of the abyss.","italic":false}]']]
